One of the most recognizable paintings in modern art, *The Starry Night* depicts the view from Van Gogh's east-facing window at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, just before sunrise. The painting shows a stylized village nestled under a swirling night sky filled with stars, dominated by a large cypress tree in the foreground and a prominent crescent moon.

Van Gogh painted this work from memory during the day, as he was not allowed to work in his bedroom during the night. The scene combines observation with imagination, creating one of the most beloved works in art history.
