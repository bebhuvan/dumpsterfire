This week's theme: **Rescue Work**

The internet feels like a dumpster fire most days, but there are still people creating thoughtful, lasting work. This issue focuses on the digital gardeners, the long-term thinkers, and the people who build things meant to outlast the next trending topic.

Featured this week is Robin Sloan's piece about planting gardens for others to tend—a perfect metaphor for what we're all trying to do here in our small corner of the internet.
