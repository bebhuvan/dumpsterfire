      <p>
        Hi, my name is Bhuvan and I do a bunch of random things on the internet. I've added links below—you can check them out.
      </p>

      <p>
        This site has been in the works for a very long time. The previous iteration was softly murdered, and before that, I tried creating a digital garden that didn't go as planned. Nonetheless, it was a learning experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since I bought this domain, the idea was to create a small corner on the internet where you can discover cool, thoughtful, insightful, thought-provoking, awe-inspiring things. I don't know who first called the internet a dumpster fire, but it's true—and it often feels like it's getting worse, spreading to other corners and leaving noxious fumes in its wake.
      </p>

      <p>
        But despite that, not all of the internet has been incinerated. There are still amazing corners with delightfully wonderful stuff. For various reasons—most people don't care about the good stuff, mindless doomscrolling, the popularity of reels, people preferring to scroll anything rather than read something worthwhile, unthinking epidemics, perverted algorithmic attention distribution—the good stuff doesn't get nearly enough attention.
      </p>

      <p>
        This probably has always been the case. I don't fully fall into the camp that says the internet has ruined everything and civilization is going to hell. The internet does have a pernicious effect on what thoughtful people with working brains would deem good, but I think the supply of garbage is so vast that good stuff gets drowned in the dilution. This isn't really a 21st century problem—it's always been this way.
      </p>

      <p>
        It often feels like people who used to write really good things have become dejected by lack of attention and given up. But on platforms like Substack, there's a renaissance of amazing, thought-provoking writing. So I don't buy the argument that internet equals bad and everything is ruined. I'm writing this in September 2025, and I'm reading more thought-provoking, good things than at pretty much any point in my life.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I bought the domain, I wanted to create a curated blog sharing all the good things I read. Instead, it became another blog where I write longer posts. But the idea of curating things for people looking for intellectual nourishment remained in my head. This isn't born from some savior complex—it's selfish. If I read and share good things, it gives me incentive to read good things in the first place. If others find value in the links I share, that's a bonus. As much as I'd like to think I'm the Mother Teresa of links, I'll hold off on that claim.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the past few months, I've been playing around with AI coding tools like Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and others. All the side projects I ever wanted to create are quickly becoming reality. I got Claude Code to code this weird-looking theme for the site, and I finally figured it's time to kill the previous version and recreate what I originally intended.
      </p>

      <p>
        What this site is for: a small corner on the internet where I share good articles, videos, podcasts, research papers, etc. that I come across. Instead of summarizing, I want to share interesting themes, plotlines, and tidbits I find compelling, along with the link.
      </p>

      <p>
        Why not summaries? You can find any piece of content and summarize it thanks to AI tools—you don't need me for that. Also, summarization sucks the joy out of really good things, and I don't want to contribute to a culture of compression. I think there are real dangers there, but that's a personal belief.
      </p>

      <p>
        I want to be clear: I am using AI to help create these themes and write. Why? This isn't my full-time job—I have another job that takes up my entire time. I also write in other places (links below). Whatever time is left on weekends goes toward building other things I want to create.
      </p>

      <p>
        I understand there's stigma around saying themes are written by AI, but that's not really the case. Every link on this site is something I've read, watched, or heard. I'm not using AI to find links—just to help write. This isn't AI-powered spam; it's co-writing with AI so I can save time while fulfilling my long-held desire to share really good things. These AI tools are, in many ways, better writers than I'll ever be, so it would be foolish not to use them.
      </p>

      <p>
        But every insight, every link, it's all 100% human curation. You don't have to worry about this being another AI spam website. This is the work of one information addict on the internet, a deeply personal endeavor.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hope you find this corner as a refuge from the dumpster fire that is the internet. Happy rabbit hole diving!
