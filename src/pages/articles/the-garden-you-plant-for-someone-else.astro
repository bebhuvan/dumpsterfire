  curatorNotes="This piece fundamentally changed how I think about creating things for the internet. Sloan's meditation on websites, olive trees, and planning for futures we won't optimize for feels especially urgent in our current moment of AI-generated everything. I've read this four times now. Each reading reveals something I wasn't ready to see before. The section about 'gardening in public' particularly resonates—it's essentially what we're doing here at From the Dumpster Fire."
  pullQuote="The web is still a wilderness, for those who know how to look. It's still possible to plant something and watch it grow in unexpected ways, touched by other hands, cross-pollinated by other minds."

  <p>Sloan explores the radical act of creating digital spaces meant to evolve slowly, outside the optimization loops of modern platforms. He draws parallels between tending online projects and planting olive groves—both require faith in a future you might not see, but others will inhabit.</p>
  
  <p>The essay challenges our obsession with metrics and immediate feedback, suggesting instead that the most meaningful digital work might be that which unfolds over decades, accumulating meaning like sediment, readable only in geological time.</p>

  <p>"I'm thinking about olive trees," Sloan writes, "planted by people who knew they would never taste the fruit." This becomes a metaphor for the kind of patient, generous creation that the internet desperately needs more of.</p>

  <p>The piece touches on everything from RSS feeds to personal websites to the deep satisfaction of maintaining something over time. It's a manifesto for the slow web, the handmade web, the web that remembers it was built by humans for humans.</p>

  <p>What strikes me most is Sloan's argument that the best digital gardens aren't optimized for discovery or engagement—they're optimized for depth, for connection, for the kind of serendipitous encounter that changes how you think about everything.</p>

  <p>This is essential reading for anyone who builds things on the internet and wonders if there's another way—one that prioritizes longevity over virality, community over metrics, and wisdom over information.</p>
